# Landing-Page-2

This is a mock-up landing page I am building as part of the OTP curriculum. 
It is the final project of the HTML & CSS Foundation section, and will help assess
the skills I've aquired in HTML/CSS so far, as well test my problem-solving skills. 

I have created this ReadMe document before cloning this repo to my PC. I'll figure
out what's standard procedure as I progress.
